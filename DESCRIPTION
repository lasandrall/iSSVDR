Description: The integrative sparse singular value decomposition (iSSVD) package implements the iSSVD algorithm for integrative biclustering of data from multiple sources.  Biclustering refers to simultaneous clustering of samples and columns of a data matrix. This algorithm is useful for detecting  sample subgroups characterized by specific groups of variables. iSSVD incorporates stability selection to control Type I error rates, estimates the probability of samples and variables to belong to a bicluster, finds stable biclusters, resulting in interpretable row-column associations.
