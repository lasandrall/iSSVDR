\title{Generate simulated data for a given number of clusters}
\usage{
generateData(
  myseed = 25L,
  n = 200L,
  p = 1000L,
  D = 2L,
  rowsize = 50L,
  colsize = 100L,
  numbers = 1L,
  sigma = 0.1,
  nbicluster = 4L,
  orthonm = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{myseed}{An integer to set a seed. Need to append a letter L to the integer, for example 25L. It's set to a default value of 25.}

\item{n}{An even integer for the number of rows in the generated data. It's set to a default value of 200.}

\item{p}{An integer for the number of the number of columns in the generated data. It's set to a default value of 1000.}

\item{D}{The number of views or data sources. In multi-view matrix factorization, you often have data from multiple sources or views. D controls how many such views are generated. It's set to a default value of 2.}

\item{rowsize}{An integer for the number of rows in each submatrix. It's set to a default value of 50.}

\item{colsize}{An integer for the number of columns in each submatrix. It's set to a default value of 100.}

\item{numbers}{An integer for the number of sets of data matrices to be generated. It's set to a default value of 1.}

\item{sigma}{A number for the standard deviation of the random noise added to the data. It's set to a default value of 0.1.}

\item{nbicluster}{The number of clusters in the row and column spaces for each synthetic dataset. It's set to a default value of 4.}

\item{orthonm}{A boolean flag. If TRUE, The left singular vector and right singular vector are orthogonalized. The default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
The function will return a list of synthetic data matrices. The list has a structure that reflects the different samples and factors in the generated data.
}
\description{
The function generate data matrices with the truth of underlying biclusters that can be used for dianostics.

# Generate the data list

# Select two data X1, X2 from the generated data list

# Combine two data into a list
