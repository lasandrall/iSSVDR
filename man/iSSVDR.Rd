\description{
The integrative sparse singular value decomposition (iSSVD) is based on sparse singular value decomposition for single-view data to data from multiple views. Theproposedalgorithmestimatestheprobabilityof samplesandvariables tobelongtoabicluster, finds stablebiclusters, andresults in interpretable row-column associations. Simulations and real data analyses show that iSSVD out performs several other single- and multi-view biclustering methods and is able to detect meaningful biclusters.

\details{
Suppose that data are available from \eqn{D} different views, and each view is arranged in an \eqn{n \times p^{(d)}} matrix \eqn{X^{(d)}}, where
the superscript \eqn{d} corresponds to the \eqn{d}-th view. For instance, for the same set of \eqn{n} individuals,
matrix \eqn{X^{(1)}} consists of RNA sequencing data and \eqn{X^{(2)}} consists of proteomics data, for \eqn{D = 2} views.
We wish to cluster the \eqn{p^{(d)}} variables, and the \eqn{n} subjects so that each subject subgroup is
associated with a specific variable subgroup of relevant variables. We consider estimating the left and right singular vectors and inferring the non-zero coefficients, sample clusters, and variable clusters. We subsample variables in each view \eqn{I} times without
replacement, while ensuring that each view contains the same set of samples. Please refer to the main paper \href{https://doi.org/10.1177/09622802221122427}{Zhang, Weijie, et al. "Robust integrative biclustering for multi-view data." Statistical methods in medical research 31.11 (2022): 2201-2216.} for more details. For this R manuscript, \eqn{X^{(d)}}, \eqn{X^{(1)}}, \eqn{X^{(2)}} and  \eqn{p^{(d)}} is not showing as what I want
